#summary This page is intended to contain all necessary steps in order to install the application.
== Maven  ==
Configure environment variable:
*MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx900m*
== Eclipse  ==
*VM arguments:*
Eclipse->Preferences->Installed JRE(The one used to run the project)->Edit->VM arguments
  *--Xmx900m  
  Extra memory is needed when decoding the grib files. 
  *--Dfile.encoding=utf8  
  When hibernate hbm2ddlTool inserts data from import.sql the data is inserted using the platform file encoding. So its necessary to config the eclipse virtual machine to use Utf8 encoding.
     ***Note: When running on tomcat this issue should be considered.*




== DB  ==

  # Download and Install Mysql version 5.1.
  # Configure db.properties located in:(?) with port, schema, user and pass.
  # Add this line to the mysql config file below `[mysqld]` tag:
{{{
   #
   # The number of files that the operating system allows mysqld to open.
   #
   open-files-limit=3000
}}}
  # Start the mysql server.
