Every day check the issues list ordered by priority.

Issue priority:
  * *Critical:* Must be solved urgently, its a blocking issue. 
  * *High:* Needed to solve it in the current day if it is possible. Maybe somebody couldn't finish a started task.
  * *Medium:* Isn't urgent to be solved, catch these when all highest priorities issues were solved.
  * *Low:* Solve these could be cool!!!
