Also, if you have any history of coastal observations a day with the maximum height reached by the waves at that location (a daily observation of maximum height), may train a skilled forecaster located exactly in the coordinates of the registered spot.

whyRegisterDesc = You can use the system anonymously without a user account, but this way only have access to spots created by you or created and declared as public by other users who intend to share these predictions. As anonymous user you will see the predictions and descriptions of PUBLIC spots, as well as comparisons between these spots. Log into the system takes just a moment, filling out a simple form which requires no personal information or private. As registered user you can enlist your favorite spots in the system, from anywhere in the world to have access to a detailed forecast near that location, plus if you have historical information with the height of the waves that arrived at the coast you can train a specialized predictor for a more accurate prediction exactly where the wave breaks. Also as a registered user you can generate your own comparisons between spots and keep them in the system, to have them available at any time, avoiding the trouble of having to continually generate it.

If the wave height contains decimal values as shown in the image, use the dot(.) as decimal separator. Use text files with TXT format.
