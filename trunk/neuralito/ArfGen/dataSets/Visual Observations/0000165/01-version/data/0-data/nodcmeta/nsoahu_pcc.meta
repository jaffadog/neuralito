#TITLE: 
Surf Observations from the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii 1968 - 1998

#PROJECT:
These data were tabulated through the personal interest
of Mr. Larry Goddard, an engineer with an interest in surfing
and statistics.

#ABSTRACT:
Surf observations from the North Shore, Oahu, Oahu are made on a daily
basis by City and County of Honolulu lifeguards as well as local
surfers.  Although there is uncertainty of rough 20% for any given
observations, this set of data captures the general trends and
episodic events.

#PURPOSE:
The observations were gathered into a dataset with the intention
of applying statistics to better understand the mean patterns
and trends and to document episodic events.

#LOCATION EXTREMES:
SOUTHERNMOST LATITUDE:  21.65
SOUTHERNMOST LATITUDE HEMISPHERE: N
NORTHERNMOST LATITUDE:  21.70
NORTHERNMOST LATITUDE HEMISPHERE: N
WESTERNMOST LONGITUDE: 158.20
WESTERNMOST LONGITUDE HEMISPHERE: W 
EASTERNMOST LONGITUDE: 158.00
EASTERNMOST LONGITUDE HEMISPHERE: W  

#LOCATION KEYWORDS: Oahu, Hawaii, North Pacific Ocean

#SAMPLING STATIONS: Laniakea Beach, Waimea Bay, Sunset Beach

Observation location was chosen to represent the
section along the coast with the largest surf, which
various from spot to spot depending on swell direction
and wave size.

Laniakea : swells from north through northeast and heights under 15'
Sunset Beach: swells from west through north and heights under 15'
Waimea Bay: all swell directions with surf 15'+

#BEGIN AND END DATES: 
August 1968 - July 1998

#SAMPLING PERIODS:
daily

#PARAMETERS: 
height of breaking surf in feet

#METHODOLOGY:
For the period 1968-8/1987, the primary observers were
Larry Goddard, Bernie Baker (well-known surf photographer),
Randy Rarick (professional surfer (1970s) and Director of the
Association of Professional Surfers (1980-90s), Peter Cole, 
a mathmatician and competative swimmer, and Lt. Albert Benson.  
All these individuals lived on the North Shore of Oahu 
during this period and are very avid surfers.

For the Period 9/1987 - 7/1998, the primary observers were
the City and County of Hawaii lifeguards, who make several
observations per day and provide them to the National Weather
Service.  Mr. Peter Cole made adjustments to some observations
based on his own observations and judgement.  Larry
Goddard estimates that the lifeguards underestimate
the heights by about 15%; eg., the lifeguards would
call an actual 6' wave as 5'; 12' one as 10', etc. 

The site of the observations is noted above (#SAMPLING STATIONS). 

It has been common practice by surfers and lifeguards to
grossly underestimate the height of the breaking waves.
For a 6' tall surfer riding a wave as high as his head,
the surf is recorded as 3'.  There is no good explanation
for the original of this observing system, but it has been
consistent throughout this dataset. Thus, double the height
of each recorded value to get the more realistic trough to
crest height of a breaking wave at the moment of its 
maximum size.

Due to the uncertainties of observing waves, an error
of +/- 20% of the given observation can be expected.
Thus, a value recorded as 10' could have been
somewhere between 8' and 12'; a value recorded as 25'
could actually be somewhere from 20' to 30'.  And
as mentioned above, remember to double the given
observatin for the true trough to crest height during
the time of the most extreme shoaling and refracting,
which drops the trough and raises the crest.

The recorded values in this dataset represent the highest 
observations of a given day.  Thus, if the surf was 8' in the 
morning and 3' in the evening, the value of 8' would be recorded.  
The observations also represent the largest of the groups 
of waves which arrive.  This would be similar to the highest 1/10
wave heights (that is, take the higest 10% of the waves,
add them up, and divide by the number of these waves).
