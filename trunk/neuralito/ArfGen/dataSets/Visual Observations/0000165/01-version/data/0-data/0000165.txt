Pat,
Thanks for the data - one of the more interesting data sets at NODC.
The Accession Number is 0000165.

I have not received the ADCP data yet.

My retirement date is 29 July, which gives me 38 working days to clean my office.

Bye for now,
Doug

Hi Doug,

I put in ftp.nodc....... liaison area

nsoahu_pcc.tar.Z


Organized as I do all of them, uncompress (unix)
then untar (unix), then files actually PC-compatible.

Information as usual under nodcmeta.

Please let me know if  you get it OK.

When is your retirement?  Soon?

I mailed the ADCP exabyte tape.  Please
let me know if you get that.

All the best to you in retirement,

Cheers, Pat
