#TITLE: 
Surf Observations from the South Shore of Oahu, Hawaii 1972-1987

#PROJECT:
These data were tabulated through the personal interest
of Mr. Larry Goddard, an engineer with an interest in surfing
and statistics.

#ABSTRACT:
Surf observations from the south shore, Oahu, were made on a daily
basis by Mr. Larry Goddard or several of his competent surfer
friends.  Observations typically were made from either the Ala
Moana area or the Nanatorium/Kapiolani Park area.  On days
he could not make it to the south shore, west side spots
Maili Point or Makaha with direct south exposure were used.
Although there is uncertainty of rough 20% for any given
observations, this set of data captures the general trends and
episodic events.

#PURPOSE:
The observations were gathered into a dataset with the intention
of applying statistics to better understand the mean patterns
and trends and to document episodic events.

#LOCATION EXTREMES:
SOUTHERNMOST LATITUDE:  21.26
SOUTHERNMOST LATITUDE HEMISPHERE: N
NORTHERNMOST LATITUDE:  21.42
NORTHERNMOST LATITUDE HEMISPHERE: N
WESTERNMOST LONGITUDE: 158.18
WESTERNMOST LONGITUDE HEMISPHERE: W 
EASTERNMOST LONGITUDE: 157.83
EASTERNMOST LONGITUDE HEMISPHERE: W  

#LOCATION KEYWORDS: Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii, North Pacific Ocean

#SAMPLING STATIONS: Publics (Nanatorium), Ala Moana, Maili, Makaha

Observation location was chosen to represent the
section along the coast with the largest surf, which
various from spot to spot depending on swell direction, tide,
and wave size.

#BEGIN AND END DATES: 
01 March 1972 -  20 November 1987

#SAMPLING PERIODS:
daily

#PARAMETERS: 
height of breaking surf in feet

#METHODOLOGY:

Line of site method was applied for judging the
height of the shoreward-facing wave front at the
moment of maximum cresting above the sea level.
The observer notes the height of his eyes above
the sea level relative to the height of the crest.
On many occassions, the lifeguard towers were used
to climb to a height equal to the breaking waves
in a horizontal sense.  In other cases, the size
of the wave was estimated by comparing a surfer
to the breaking swell.  At Ala Moana, a pole in
the channel could be used to judge the wave size.
The pole was knocked out by Hurricane Iwa in
1982.

Uncertainty is typically 20% of the wave height.  
In addition, this method does not include the 
contribution to wave height from the wave trough, 
which is below sea level and usually many yards 
ahead of the steep wave face.  Thus, roughly 5% 
of the height is underestimated due to lack of 
information of the trough height.

Note, the heights in this database are using the
"Goddard" scale.  To find the equivalent height
as used by the lifeguards, multiply the Goddard
height by 2/3 (or divide by 1.5); ie. 6' (Goddard)
is equivalent to 4' (lifeguard).  The public in
Hawaii is familiar with the lifeguard's size
scheme, which grossly underestimates by roughly
half the true oceanographic defination of wave height.

The recorded values in this dataset represent the highest 
observations of a given day.  Thus, if the surf was 8' 
in the morning and 3' in the evening, the value of 8' 
would be recorded.  The observations also represent the 
largest of the groups of waves which arrive.  This would 
be similar to the highest 1/10 wave heights (that is, 
take the higest 10% of the waves, add them up, and 
divide by the number of these waves).

#NUMBER OF DATA UNITS:
1 general location (south shore, Oahu)

#MISCELLANEOUS:
A similar dataset was made available for
the north shore of Oahu.  Note the north
shore database uses the "lifeguard" size
scheme, while the south shore database
uses the "Goddard" scheme.
