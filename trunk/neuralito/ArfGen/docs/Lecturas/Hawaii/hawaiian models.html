        <h3>Model Boundaries</h3>

		<p id="article">
Here we have the Northeast and Southwest model boundaries for each
domain. Latitude is given in degrees North and Longitude in degrees
West. <img src="hawaiian%20models_files/model-aerial.jpg" width="718" height="539">

        <h3>Global WW3 Model</h3>

		<p id="article">
Through a collaborative effort with NOAA/NCEP, and NWS Honolulu, we
have implemented a global scale WW3 model. The global model is
initialized 4 times daily: 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 Greenwich Mean
Time (GMT), and is forced with NOAA/NCEPÂ’s global forecast system (GFS)
winds. This model is designed to capture the large scale ocean waves,
provide spectral boundary conditions for the Hawaii regional WW3 model,
and most importantly, a 180 hour (7.5 days) forecast. </p>

        <h3>Hawaii WW3 Model (Regional Scale)</h3>

		<p id="article">
The Global WW3 model provides boundary conditions for Hawaii WW3. The
primary purpose of the regional model is to capture the Island effects
such as island shadowing, refraction, and accurate modeling of local
wind waves. Hawaii WW3 is forced with winds from UH Meteorology
department operational 7.5 day mesoscale model which has a more
suitable spatial resolution than the global scale wind field. Similar
to Global WW3, Hawaii WW3 is run 4 times daily directly after Global
WW3 and also provides a 180 hour forecast. Hawaii WW3 is used to
further nest into nearshore island scale models. </p>

        <h3>Kauai, Oahu, Maui County, and the Big Island SWAN Models (Island Scale)</h3>

		<p id="article">
In order to capture the shallow water effects and the nearshore coastal
dynamics such as refracting, shoaling, and smaller scale shadowing, a
high resolution SWAN model is utilized to provide a 180 hour forecast.
These models are run directly after Hawaii WW3 has completed. Please
note that this nested model setup is in the testing and validation
phase. While considerable effort has been made to implement all model
components in a thorough, correct, and accurate manner, numerous
sources of error are possible. As such, please use this data with the
caution appropriate for any ocean related activity </p>
