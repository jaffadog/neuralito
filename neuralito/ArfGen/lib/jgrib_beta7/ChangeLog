2006-07-27	Peter Gylling  <frv_peg at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Added samples directory to CVS. It's the goal to keep several
	  types of GRIB records in the samples directory, so we optain
	  a standard way of testing the library, when functionality is
	  extended or code internally is reorganized.
	- Added README file, working towards stable release
	- Added README.samples to document general content of the samples directory
	- Fixed javadoc generation in GribPDSLevel.java, now no warnings is generated
	  using the standard doclet version 1.5.0_05
	- Added static version method to GribFile.java, so users can uptain the
	  installed version from a jar file.
	- Updated build.xml to create full version build files, where GRIB docs and
	  GRIB samples is included.	  
	  
2006-07-26	Peter Gylling  <frv_peg at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Added a copy of NCEP Office note 388 as HTML in documentation
	  folder into cvs. This is the most recent documentation available
	  about the extentions to the GRIB edition 1 standard, that is available
	  on the internet today.
	- Extended GribPDSLevel.java to manage GFS grib files from NCEP
	  without issuing warnings.
	  	  
2006-07-25	Peter Gylling  <frv_peg at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Added Standard GPL licence information, a short notice in all
	  files and a COPYRIGHT file to distribute together with the
	  library. Just to make sure, that no one is left in doubt
	  of whether or not they may use the library.
	- Added AUTHORS file to give correct credit to the original
	  author: Benjamin Stark and the current developers.
	- Added example code to show how to turn on JGRIB debug info
	- Added latest log4j binary to cvs, so logging is possible
	- Logging is though far from completely implemented
	- Update of constructor documentation in GribRecordBDS.java,
	  as stated in JGRIB help forum by khalid daher.
	  	  
2006-07-20	Peter Gylling  <frv_peg at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Tagged all source with beta_rel-6 tag, so changes easily
	  can be reversed.
	- Merged changes into official jgrib cvs
	- Changed build.xml to echo beta release 7 to indicate changes
	  has been applied.

2005-10-05	Peter Gylling  <frv_peg at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Changed GribRecordGDS into an abstract class
	  as intended by RDG and made all common methods
	  known in the subclasses abstract. This way it
	  becomes easier to extend the library with new
	  types of GRIB files.
	- Changed GribTabPool so it wont complain during compile
	  as it now do call the intended methods in 
	  GribPDSParamTable, but the class remains deprecated.  
	  
2005-10-04	Peter Gylling  <frv_peg at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Added the ChangeLog file
	- Autogenerated lots of javadoc documentation
	- Deprecated the GribTab class, as the functionality
	  is provided in the GribPDSParameter class.
