Bugs:
	- Of course you will find bugs. We are trying hard to make this library as

	  when we need to extend our own production code, that the library gets the 
	  attention needed to run general test of the code.
	- Please check out latest code from CVS, before reporting a bug. We don't 
	  have the ressources needed to support code, which is not up to date.
